          <p>
            At Nucleus Accelerator, we believe great ideas deserve a global
            stage. We are a passionate team dedicated to helping startups not
            just dream big but expand boldly into the world's most dynamic
            markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to bridge the gap between visionary founders and the
            corporate expertise, cultural understanding, and strategic guidance
            they need to thrive internationally. We don't just mentor â€” we walk
            alongside you, unlocking doors and smoothing the path to growth.
